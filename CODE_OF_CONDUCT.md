# Code of Conduct — Sendium Community

We are committed to a respectful, inclusive, and helpful community for everyone.
By participating in Sendium spaces, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct.

## Purpose
This Code exists to keep our community focused, welcoming, and productive for
developers, integrators, partners, and contributors working with **Sendium OS /
SMS Gateway** and related messaging infrastructure.

## Expected Behavior
- Be respectful, professional, and considerate in speech and action.
- Assume good intent; disagree constructively and focus on ideas, not people.
- Keep discussions on-topic (Sendium, OSS SMS gateways, messaging APIs/infra).
- Share context when asking for help (versions, logs, steps tried); provide
  clear, reproducible answers when helping others.
- Respect privacy and confidentiality; obtain consent before sharing content.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, personal attacks, hate speech, slurs, threats, or stalking.
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome advances of any kind.
- Doxxing or sharing others’ private information.
- Spam, undisclosed self-promotion, or off-topic commercial activity.
- Posting illegal content, malware, or instructions that enable abuse/fraud.
- Public disclosure of security vulnerabilities (see **Security** below).

## Security & Responsible Disclosure
Do **not** publicly post potential vulnerabilities. Report security issues
privately to **info@sendium.org** with details and steps to reproduce.
We will acknowledge and respond promptly.

## Scope
This Code applies to all official Sendium spaces, including but not limited to:
GitHub (repos, Issues, Discussions), community forums, Facebook/LinkedIn groups,
events/office hours, and any direct communications related to these spaces.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness a violation, or have any concerns:
- Email **info@sendium.org** with links, screenshots, and context.
- If you feel unsafe posting publicly, contact us privately—confidentiality will
  be respected to the fullest extent possible.

## Enforcement
Moderators may take any action they deem appropriate to maintain a safe,
high-quality environment, including:
- Editing/moving/removing content
- Temporary or permanent restrictions/bans
- Escalation to Sendium leadership (for severe or repeated violations)

We will strive to be fair, consistent, and transparent, but reserve discretion
to act quickly in urgent situations.

## Moderation Guidelines (What We Look For)
- **Relevance:** on-topic, solution-oriented contributions
- **Civility:** professional tone, inclusive language
- **Safety:** no sensitive data or exploitable details in public threads

## Acknowledgment
This Code is inspired by industry best practices and the spirit of the
Contributor Covenant.
